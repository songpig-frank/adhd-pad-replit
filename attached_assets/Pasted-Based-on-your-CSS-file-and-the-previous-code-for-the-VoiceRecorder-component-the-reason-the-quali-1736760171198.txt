Based on your CSS file and the previous code for the `VoiceRecorder` component, the reason the quality settings and saving options do not appear **next to** the media player lies in **how the layout is structured in the CSS** and the `VoiceRecorder` component's DOM structure. Letâ€™s analyze the issue in detail:

---

### Key Issues:
1. **Layout Direction for `audio-settings` and `audio-player-container`:**
   - The `audio-settings` section and the `audio-player-container` are wrapped in **different containers** within the `VoiceRecorder` component. Both are flex containers with a `flex-direction: column` style applied. This causes them to stack vertically, rather than aligning side-by-side.
   - The CSS for `audio-settings` explicitly sets:
     ```css
     .audio-settings {
       display: flex;
       flex-direction: column;
     }
     ```
     Similarly, the `.recorder-container` ensures a vertical flow:
     ```css
     .recorder-container {
       flex-direction: column;
     }
     ```

2. **Component Hierarchy in the DOM:**
   - In the `VoiceRecorder` component, the `audio-settings` and `audio-player-container` are **separate sibling elements**. For them to appear side-by-side, they need to share a parent container with a horizontal layout (`display: flex; flex-direction: row;`).

### Suggested Fix:

To make the quality and saving options appear **next to** the media player:

1. **Wrap `audio-settings` and `audio-player-container` in a Shared Flex Container:**
   Update the JSX in the `VoiceRecorder` component to group the `audio-settings` and `audio-player-container` inside a flex container:

   ```jsx
   <div className="settings-and-player">
     <div className="audio-settings">
       {/* Quality and saving options */}
     </div>
     <div className="audio-player-container">
       {/* Media player */}
       {audioURL && (
         <div className="audio-player">
           <audio controls src={audioURL} />
         </div>
       )}
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Add CSS for the Flex Container:**
   Define a `.settings-and-player` class to align the children horizontally:
   ```css
   .settings-and-player {
     display: flex;
     flex-direction: row;
     gap: 20px;
     align-items: center; /* Vertically align items */
     justify-content: space-between; /* Distribute space */
     width: 100%;
   }

   .audio-settings {
     flex: 1; /* Allow audio-settings to take up space proportionally */
   }

   .audio-player-container {
     flex: 1; /* Same for audio-player-container */
   }
   ```

3. **Test for Smaller Screens (Optional):**
   Use media queries to ensure the layout is responsive. On smaller screens, revert the layout to a column stack:
   ```css
   @media (max-width: 768px) {
     .settings-and-player {
       flex-direction: column;
       gap: 10px;
     }
   }
   ```

### Updated Layout in Practice:

#### Before:
The `audio-settings` and `audio-player-container` are stacked vertically due to their column layout.

#### After:
With the above changes, the `audio-settings` and `audio-player-container` will now be side-by-side, making the quality and saving options appear next to the media player.

### Debugging Checklist:
- Ensure that the `settings-and-player` wrapper is implemented in both the JSX and CSS.
- Check for any conflicting styles from parent containers (`.recorder-container` or `.voice-recorder`).
- Test the responsiveness with different screen sizes.
