## Text Justification Issue
- **Date**: January 12, 2024
- **Description**: Text justification in task description section is not working correctly. The text blocks need proper justification with the last line aligned left.
- **Status**: Unresolved
- **Component**: src/App.css
- **Impact**: Visual presentation of task descriptions is affected
- **Priority**: Medium

## Known Issues
1. CSS text-align-last and text-align properties are not providing consistent text justification across browsers

3. Current implementation may cause uneven spacing between words

## Next Steps
- Investigate alternative CSS approaches for text justification
- Consider implementing a JavaScript-based text justification solution
